## Conflict Resolution Guide

### For Closed PRs with Conflicts (Priority: High)

#### Step 1: Identify Conflicting Files
```bash
# Check the diff for conflicting areas
git diff main..branch-name
```

#### Step 2: Manual Resolution Process
1. **Checkout the conflicting branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout branch-name
   ```

2. **Update from main**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git merge origin/main
   ```

3. **Resolve conflicts manually**:
   - Edit conflicting files
   - Remove conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
   - Test the resolution

4. **Commit the resolution**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
   ```

#### Step 3: Reopen and Merge
1. **Push the resolved branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin branch-name
   ```

2. **Create a new PR or reopen the existing one**

### Common Conflict Patterns Observed

1. **README.md conflicts**: Multiple PRs modifying the same sections
2. **Requirements.txt conflicts**: Dependencies being added simultaneously
3. **Package structure changes**: Module imports and file organization

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Resolve c1nder-codex PRs #24 and #25**:
   - These are completely unmergeable due to conflicts
   - Manual intervention required to salvage the work

2. **Implement conflict prevention**:
   - Set up branch protection rules
   - Require PR reviews before merging
   - Use rebase workflow instead of merge commits

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Automated conflict detection**:
   - Set up GitHub Actions to detect conflicts early
   - Implement automated conflict resolution for simple cases

2. **Better branching strategy**:
   - Use feature branches with descriptive names
   - Implement semantic versioning for releases

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create CONTRIBUTING.md with conflict resolution guidelines
   - Document the preferred merge strategy

## Specific File Conflicts Analysis

### Most Problematic Files
1. **README.md** - Multiple PRs modifying documentation
2. **requirements.txt** - Dependency conflicts
3. **pyproject.toml** - Package configuration conflicts

### Suggested Resolution Strategy
1. **Merge documentation PRs first** (lowest risk)
2. **Resolve dependency conflicts** (medium risk)
3. **Handle structural changes last** (highest risk)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Resolve conflicts in c1nder-codex PRs #24 and #25
2. **Short-term**: Review and merge clean PRs in order of priority
3. **Long-term**: Implement automated conflict detection and prevention
